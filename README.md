# Predicting Online Gaming Behavior: A Machine Learning Approach

Online gaming has become a significant part of modern entertainment, with millions of players worldwide engaging in various games. Understanding and predicting player behavior is crucial for game developers and publishers to enhance user experience, optimize game design, and maximize revenue. This project aims to develop a machine learning model that can accurately predict online gaming behavior, specifically focusing on player engagement levels. By analyzing a rich dataset of player interactions, we aim to identify patterns and trends that can inform game development decisions and improve the overall gaming experience.
